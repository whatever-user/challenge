#Knowledge Plaza Challenge

[Eder Elorriaga](http://gexplorer.org), a fun Spanish software developer, is looking for a great company to join and build awesome software.

I'm especially looking for:
- 1 frontend Javascript developer position to work with AngularJS and potentially ReactJS
- An interesting project to be part of
- A company where the quality of the software is important and where there is place to grow as a developer
- A team where agile principles are not unknown
- A place where you can develop sitting in top of a giant ball using a junior developer as a saddle [optional]

This developer is available for remote working, mainly because of the incoming new member of his family, a pretty little baby girl due date December 2nd. And yes, I'd like to earn quite well.

Want to meet me? I've been working in the frontend challenge, so you can check the code out to see what I've been up to. I found the offer a couple of days before starting a vacation trip with my wife so I've been working on it on and off from the swimming pool of the hotel whenever it's possible. Since I find this offer interesting and I don't know when it will end, I'm sending you this work in progress. If you want to meet me, don't hesitate to contact me: eder.elorriaga@gmail.com
